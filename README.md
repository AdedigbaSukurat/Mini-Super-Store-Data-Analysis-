# Mini-Super-Store-Data-Analysis
 This project analyzes sales data from a mini superstore dataset. The dashboard was built in Excel to visualize sales trends, profitability, and best-performing products. 
## Project Overview 
The Mini Superstore Sales Dashboard is an Excel-based report designed to analyze sales performance across multiple years, product categories, and outlet types. It visualizes key metrics such as total sales, item count, top-selling products, and profitability trends between 1985 and 2009.
This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify best-performing product categories, underperforming items, and the contribution of different outlet sizes and types. With dynamic filters and interactive visuals, it supports informed decision-making for marketing, inventory, and sales strategy optimization.

## Insights
- Frozen foods and snack foods are top-selling categories
- Certain outlets and items performed poorly in terms of profitability
- Only 7.38% of items achieved high sales performance
## Recommendations  
- #### Prioritize High-Performing Categories:
Frozen Foods and Snack Foods consistently generate the highest sales. Increase inventory, promotions, and shelf space for these categories to drive further revenue growth.
- #### Re-evaluate Low-Profit Products:
Items such as Toilet Cleaner – Lemon and Canned Fish – Tuna showed very low or negative profit margins. These products should be reviewed for possible discontinuation, price adjustments, or cost reduction strategies.
- #### Optimize Outlet Strategy:
High outlet size and location types contribute significantly more to sales than lower-tier outlets. Focus expansion and resource allocation on top-performing outlet types to maximize returns.
- #### Address Performance Gaps:
Only 7.38% of items achieved high sales performance. Consider running promotions, bundling, or repositioning for underperforming items to boost their visibility and sales.
-  #### Leverage Historical Sales Peaks:
1985 recorded the highest annual sales. Although this may not reflect current trends, identifying what drove peak performance in past years can inform future promotional strategies.
- #### Streamline Product Assortment:
A wide product range may be diluting profitability. Consider focusing on high-margin, fast-moving products and phasing out low performers to improve overall efficiency.
